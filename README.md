# What is HACKTOBERFEST?

> Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software. During the month of October, you are invited to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects. 
> Open source projects encourage collaboration and the freedom to use the software for any purpose you wish.

# More on OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTION:

- Open source refers to source code that is made available to the public to view, use, modify, and distribute under a license. It’s usually developed and maintained collaboratively by a community of its users. 
- Although the main point of  open source projects is to create valuable and accessible open source software, individual contributors can get plenty of personal benefit from contributing to them. 
- By collaborating with others on open source you use, you get to become part of a community where you can practice your soft skills like communication, giving and receiving feedback, emotional intelligence, etc.
