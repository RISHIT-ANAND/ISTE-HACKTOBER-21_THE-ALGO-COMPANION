<h2>Literally, CP is a sport, like any other sport.  <img src = "https://media0.giphy.com/media/KDDpcKigbfFpnejZs6/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47oy6f4zjs8g1qoiystc56cu7r9tb8a1fe76e05oty&rid=giphy.gif" width = 200px></h2>

> Let’s consider cricket for a while. You walk into bat for the first time. Bowler swings and you miss. You practice by keeping this “swing” in your mind and next time you’ll do much better. By practicing and doing it a couple of times, you’ll hit one over the ropes.

> In a programming contest, you convert plain English sentences into a code of your favorite programming language. Walk right into it, you will learn unwritten rules of the game as you play harder and get better. 

> For getting started, you don’t need to know any complex algorithms or data structures. You just need to know a programming language and start competing. As you practice, you fail, and you succeed and you will learn how to solve complex problems and how to write fast and efficient code.

<h2>Why is COMPETITIVE CODING Important:</h2>

- Improves Logic

Programming logic improves by practice. You are smart from the very beginning. With competitive programming, you continuously train yourself with algorithmic problems that test the better out of your current logic skills. By practicing more and more you get better and this improves your programming logic.


- Makes you more focused and faster

Thinking about a problem and finding its solution makes you more focused. With an improved logic, you will be able to think faster, solve problems faster, decide faster and put your thinking and solutions into code faster without going to and fro thinking which approach to use for your code.


- Helps you solve complicated problems

By doing CP you will learn how to solve complex tasks out of the ordinary tasks. This will help prepare you for a job because you can adapt and solve various kinds of problems in various types of situations.


- Teaches you how to work in teams

CP helps you learn how to effectively work together, as you must work with others on your team to complete the same task. In this situation, you will learn how to assess your team member’s strength and weakness and effectively divide responsibilities between each other.



- Make you a desirable candidate for major companies

Participating in CP contests makes you a desirable candidate for big companies. In CP organizer websites and companies, these big companies always have a look and they pick the candidates with high potential and with the best ability to solve complex tasks.
